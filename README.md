This project is my *very first project* that I actually plan to publish and share. It will likely be very poor in features, prone to bugs, messily published and messily coded.
Whilst I do hope that people will enjoy it once I actually get it in a working state, which it currently is not in, I don't expect much, this is mostly an experiment and a learning experience.


Current plans:

-Custom icon

-Birch Charcoal, a form of charcoal buffed from regular charcoal with a distinct texture, with an integration into coal recipes

-Buff to birch wood as a fuel source
