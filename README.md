# Birch Utilities
By MildToucan

This project is my *very first project* that I actually plan to publish and share. It will likely be very poor in features, prone to bugs, messily published and messily coded.
Whilst I do hope that people will enjoy it once I actually get it in a working state, which it currently is not in, I don't expect much, this is mostly an experiment and a learning experience.
If you feel like helping with this project or suggesting any ways to improve Birch as a decoration block or give it utilities, feel free to contact me about it or open an issue.

This mod intends to repurpose Birch, as it is only used sparsely by most players. By giving it utilities that fit right in with Vanilla gameplay, this mod can fit right into just about any compatible world or modpack.

## Current features:

Complete/Implemented:  
-Birch Charcoal, a form of charcoal that burns 1.5x more items compared to regular coal/charcoal

WIP:  
-Birch Reinforced Shears, shears with a birch-reinforced frame, giving extra durability (2.5x more durability)  
Currently, not all Shears features are implemented (surprisingly difficult to make custom shears, somehow.)

## Current plans/TODO List:
-Texture for Birch Reinforced Shears, finish coding Birch Reinforced Shears  
-Improved texture for Birch Charcoal
